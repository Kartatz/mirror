  * Edit media metadata, including persons, location, and additional notes
  * Flag media as “significant” for organization and/or easy retrieval later
  * Batch edit media — update the metadata of multiple media file at once
  * ⁠Create multiple project albums to keep your media organized (e.g. “Summer 2019,” “Workshop photos,” “Kitchen remodel,” etc)
  * Share to Save from other apps on your phone, such as your Photos or voice memos apps
  * “Wi-Fi-only” upload setting, for when cellular data networks are unreliable or expensive
  * Creative Commons licensing options for the media you collect and share

  <b>Benefits</b>

  Preserve
  Upload your important mobile media to a private server of your choice (using a free and open source platform like Nextcloud or ownCloud).
  Publish the media publicly to the Internet Archive for robust preservation by a third-party.

  Organize
  Create custom-named Projects to keep your media sorted in ways that make sense to you.
  Add helpful notes, location, and other contextual information one by one or in bulk.
  Enable findability and organization with folders in the app that correspond to your own private server.

  Share
  Connect to existing project albums created and managed by partners and colleagues.
  Send media to the Save app from your camera roll and other Android applications.

  Secure
  Save always uses TLS encryption, which encrypts the connection between your mobile device and your chosen destination, whether a private server or the Internet Archive.
  Save works with server software like Nextcloud that makes it easy to encrypt the data you've collected.
