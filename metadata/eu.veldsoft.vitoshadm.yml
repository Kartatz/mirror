Description: |-
  It is really simple decision maker toy. It uses random numbers. It is better
  than flipping a coin, because it has more options. The usage is very simple. You
  need to have a specific question in mind, for which it is difficult for you to
  take a solution. After that, just hit the roll button and observe the result.
